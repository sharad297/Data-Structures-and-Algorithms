## Data Structures and Algorithms
` An Algorithm is step by step set of instruction to process the data for a specific purpose. So an algorithm utilizes various data structures in a logical way to solve a specific computing problem. In this tutorial we will cover these two fundamental concepts of computer science using the Python programming language. `
